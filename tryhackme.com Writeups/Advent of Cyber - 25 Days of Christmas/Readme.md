Writeup of my 25 Days of Christmas Challenge

The challenge spans over 25days, each day with different tasks.

The Help directory consist of the supporting materials and files, and also scripts I wrote to solve the tasks. Each task is labelled according to a number. For missing numbers(eg. 20.), it indicates that there are no supporting materials/scripts for that particular task.

My writeup consist of all 25 tasks.

Do note that the actual hashes/flags/passwords are blurred due to the Terms and Conditions of TryHackMe.com.
