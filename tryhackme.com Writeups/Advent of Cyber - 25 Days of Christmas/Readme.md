Writeup of my 25 Days of Christmas Challenge

The challenge spans over 25days, each day with different challenges.

The Help directory consist of the supporting materials and files, and also scripts I wrote to solve the challenges. Each challenge is labelled according to a number. For missing numbers(eg. 20.), it indicates that there are no supporting materials/scripts for that particular challenge.

My writeup consist of all 25 challenges.

Do note that my writeup contains hashes/flags/passwords which is why I did not upload it onto the page. Please do not submit them without trying the challenges.
