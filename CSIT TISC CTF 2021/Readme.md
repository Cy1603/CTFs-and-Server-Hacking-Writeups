2021 CTF Challenge by CSIT. I've only manage to complete 1,2,3,4,7.

My writeup is written in such a way that it is more of a walkthrough perspective. I hope it can help the readers with their thought process.

Generally a fun and well-structured CTF. Looking forward to read other challengers' write-ups!
