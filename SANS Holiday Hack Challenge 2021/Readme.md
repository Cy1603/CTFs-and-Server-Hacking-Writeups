KringleCon 4: Calling Birds!
Santa and the team at the North Pole welcome you to this year's KringleCon and the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge! We've got some whimsical and wonderful challenges and talks to help you build critical cyber security skills to make the world a safer, more secure place. Enjoy yourself at the conference and make sure you check out our new holiday music soundtrack!

We need to inform you that a major construction project has been underway next to Santa's castle. Santa and the elves are not behind this project, and we caution you regarding your involvement with it. If you do engage with the leader or participants in the project next door, we urge you to be wary of their motives and goals, but always treat them with kindness, respect, and due care following the KringleCon and Holiday Hack Challenge Code of Conduct and Terms of Use.

Once you've read that code and agree to it, feel free to sign in and hop into our staging area to pick up your badge and get a brief orientation to this year's KringleCon.

Happy Holidays from the entire SANS Holiday Hack Challenge team!
