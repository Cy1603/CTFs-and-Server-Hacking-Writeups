This is a CTF challenge launched by MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) in 2019 for their cybersecurity recruitment effort.

I managed to complete 8/10 challenges. Thus, some of the writeups are incomplete, feel free to try and let me know if you can complete them!

Also, this is my first ever CTF challenge and thus my writeups may not be professionally done. I am seeking to improve too!

Within each challenge directory there could be a Base Files and a Extra Files folder.

Base Files - The CTF files provided to do the challenges.
Extra Files - My intermediary files/scripts to solve the challenges.

Information on the challenges:
1. Decoding and Decrypting PHP 
2. Reverse Engineering EXE
3. Reverse Engineering APK
4. PHP and PCAP
5. Reverse Engineering ELF
6. Memory Forensics (Incomplete)
7. Reverse Engineering EXE (Incomplete)
8. Web CTF
9. Malware Analysis PCAP
10. Memory Forensics

I thoroughly enjoyed them, hope you do too!
